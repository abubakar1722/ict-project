Purpose: The file is for a web application called "Student Budget Buddy," aimed at helping students plan their expenses in Pakistani Rupees (PKR).

Design: The app has a clean and professional look, with a light background and a neatly styled container for input fields and buttons.

Functionality: This app allows students to input their total budget and planning duration (monthly or weekly) and then add various expenses with details like category, cost, and frequency.

Visual Indicators: The app uses color coding to indicate the wisdom of spending: green for wise expenses, orange for caution, and red for unwise expenses.

Budget Analysis: Once expenses are added, the app provides a spending report, showing the total budget, savings, and any budget exceeded. It also offers advice on where to cut costs.

Interactivity: Users can navigate between different pages of the app, add multiple expenses, and get a detailed breakdown of their spending.

User-Friendly: The design is intuitive, with easy-to-use input fields, dropdowns, and clear buttons, making it accessible
